BatchFileRealtime
=================

multithreaded realtime batch file reading to richtextbox

a simple program to open *.bat files and to display the output of the cmd in the program itself while the cmd is hidded.
very handy if you just like to open a batch file as windwos no auto closes them after they finished no more screen grabbing or going through cd\ folders
uses registry to save location of the file, old style still in the program to save and use config file.
html links are active in the textbox.
