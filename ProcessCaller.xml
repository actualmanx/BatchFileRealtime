            support cancellation.  It also allows those operations to invoke delegates

            <remarks>
            Special thanks to Chad Christensen for suggestions
            on using the RichTextBox.
            Note there are a lot of issues with scrolling on a
            RichTextBox, depending upon if the cursor (selection point) 
            is in the RichTextBox or not, and if it is hidden or not.
            I've disabled the RichTextBox tabstop so that the cursor isn't
            automatically placed in the text box.
            Now setting or unsetting:
               richTextBox1.HideSelection
            will affect if the textbox is always repositioned at the bottom
              when new text is entered.
